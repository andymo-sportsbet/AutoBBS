## Current Status Summary

**Overall Progress**: 20% (12/60 tasks completed)

**Phase 1**: 100% (12/12 tasks) ✅  
**Phase 2**: 33% (2/6 tasks) 🔄  
**Phase 3**: 0% (0/4 tasks)  
**Phase 4**: 0% (0/18 tasks)  
**Phase 5**: 0% (0/10 tasks) ⚠️ **NEW - CRITICAL**  
**Phase 6**: 0% (0/10 tasks)

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Thread-local storage and logging functions implemented
2. ✅ Phase 2.1 Complete: Thread-local logging initialization in optimizer
3. ⚠️ **URGENT**: Fix tmp file thread-safety issues (Phase 5)
   - Fix `results.open` hardcoded filename (CRITICAL)
   - Fix instanceId collision formula (HIGH)
   - Fix OrderInfo.txt and .state file thread-safety (HIGH/MEDIUM)
4. 🔄 Test implementation with single thread first (backward compatibility)
5. 🔄 Test with multiple threads (2, 4, 8)
6. 🔄 Measure performance improvement

**Blockers**: None

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Thread-local storage may not be available on all platforms (mitigation: fallback implementation)
- ⚠️ Too many log files may be created (mitigation: configurable naming, optional cleanup)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Tmp files (`results.open`, `{instanceId}_OrderInfo.txt`, `{instanceId}.state`) are not thread-safe and can cause file corruption in multi-threaded runs (mitigation: Phase 5 fixes)

## Notes

- This hotfix addresses a critical performance issue affecting optimization runs
- Thread-local logging eliminates critical section contention
- Backward compatibility is maintained through fallback to global logger
- Performance improvement target: 50%+ faster optimization execution
- **NEW**: Tmp file thread-safety issues discovered and documented in `TMP_FILES_THREAD_SAFETY.md`
  - `results.open`: Hardcoded filename shared across threads (CRITICAL)
  - `{instanceId}_OrderInfo.txt`: InstanceId collisions cause file corruption (HIGH)
  - `{instanceId}.state`: File writes not protected (MEDIUM)
