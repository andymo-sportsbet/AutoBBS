  - [⬜] Ensure backward compatibility

- [⬜] Add OpenMP support detection
  - [⬜] Include `<omp.h>` if `_OPENMP` is defined

## Phase 2: Optimizer Integration

### 2.1 Initialize Thread-Local Logging in Parallel Loop

- [⬜] Modify `optimizer.c` OpenMP parallel region
  - [⬜] Locate the `#pragma omp parallel for` section
  - [⬜] Add thread-local logging initialization at start of loop
  - [⬜] Generate thread-specific log file paths
  - [⬜] Call `asirikuyLoggerInitThreadLocal()` for each thread
  - [⬜] Add debug logging for initialization

- [⬜] Implement log file path generation
  - [⬜] Determine log folder location (from config or default)
  - [⬜] Generate path: `{logFolder}/AsirikuyFramework_thread{N}.log`
  - [⬜] Handle path length limits
  - [⬜] Ensure directory exists

- [⬜] Add cleanup (optional)
  - [⬜] Consider calling `asirikuyLoggerCloseThreadLocal()` at end
  - [⬜] Or let threads clean up automatically

### 2.2 Testing and Validation

- [⬜] Test with single thread
  - [⬜] Verify backward compatibility
  - [⬜] Verify global logger still works
  - [⬜] Check log file creation

- [⬜] Test with multiple threads
  - [⬜] Run with 2 threads
  - [⬜] Run with 4 threads
  - [⬜] Verify separate log files created
  - [⬜] Verify no log corruption

- [⬜] Performance testing
  - [⬜] Measure optimization execution time before
  - [⬜] Measure optimization execution time after
  - [⬜] Compare critical section contention (use profiling)
  - [⬜] Verify performance improvement

## Phase 3: Reduce Hot Path Logging (Optional Performance Enhancement)

### 3.1 Identify Hot Path Log Calls

- [⬜] Review `tester.c` for frequent log calls
  - [⬜] Line 1380: `logInfo()` in main loop
  - [⬜] Line 1401: `logInfo()` per system per iteration
  - [⬜] Identify other high-frequency log calls

### 3.2 Optimize Logging Frequency

- [⬜] Remove or reduce frequency of hot path logs
  - [⬜] Option 1: Remove unnecessary logs entirely
  - [⬜] Option 2: Log only every N iterations (e.g., every 1000)
  - [⬜] Option 3: Use conditional compilation flag
  - [⬜] Keep important logs (errors, completion, milestones)

- [⬜] Add progress logging at milestones
  - [⬜] Log every 10% of iterations
  - [⬜] Log every 30 seconds (time-based)
  - [⬜] Log at key events (test start, completion, errors)

### 4.3 Performance Tests

## Current Status Summary

**Overall Progress**: 0% (0/50 tasks completed)

**Phase 1**: 0% (0/12 tasks)  
**Phase 2**: 0% (0/6 tasks)  
**Phase 3**: 0% (0/4 tasks)  
**Phase 4**: 0% (0/18 tasks)  
**Phase 5**: 0% (0/10 tasks)

**Next Steps**:
1. Start Phase 1.1: Add thread-local storage infrastructure
2. Implement `asirikuyLoggerInitThreadLocal()` function
3. Test with single thread first

**Blockers**: None

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Thread-local storage may not be available on all platforms (mitigation: fallback implementation)
- ⚠️ Too many log files may be created (mitigation: configurable naming, optional cleanup)

## Notes

- This hotfix addresses a critical performance issue affecting optimization runs
- Thread-local logging eliminates critical section contention
- Backward compatibility is maintained through fallback to global logger
- Performance improvement target: 50%+ faster optimization execution
